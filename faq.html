          <h1>Brief History</h1>
          <p>The  Computer Science Department was founded as part of the University's strategic objective of developing the human resources needs in key technologies required to provide the foundation for the 21st century technological developmental base for the country. The Department has since its establishment, successfully graduated 49 out of 54 students (90.7%) from the first four pioneering groups. The current number of students in the Department as of December 2019 stands at 296, comprising 88 students at Level 100, 80 students at Level 200, 84 students at Level 300, and 44 students at Level 400.The population of female students is 18.5%. The Department currently has 8 full-time teaching staff (1 staff on PhD study leave), 6 part-time staff, 8 teaching assistants, 8 national service personnel, 3 technical supporting staff, and 1 administrative assistant. The state of the Department generally remains strong as a result of a combination of aggressive efforts to provide quality teaching, hiring new faculty, facilitate upgrading of teaching staff with MPhil degree to PhD, revitalize the undergraduate curriculum, and promoting short term visits by Visiting Scholars.
